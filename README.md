# Langar

![alt tag](https://github.com/ammazzarella/Langar/blob/master/Documentation/Langar%20Sample.png)

Langar is a one-weight Latin-Gurmukhi display font based on informal, playful letterforms. 
It broadly follows the ‘upright-italic’ style of Latin fonts, experimenting with and introducing a similar style for the Gurmukhi script. 
Langar's harmonised Latin-Gurmukhi design aims to expand the possibilities for both the general user and the specialised designer working with bilingual texts by providing a good quality display option. 
The design specifically caters to characterful display at larger sizes, providing a contrasting secondary style to most text typefaces generally available for Latin-Gurmukhi texts.

# Typeland

The Langar project is led by Typeland.

Typeland is an independent type foundry specialising in creating original designs for a wide range of scripts. Taking an utterly indulgent approach, we believe in creating typefaces that we thoroughly enjoy crafting and would greatly enjoy using – in other words, we design unapologetically to remedy boredom and neutrality. Typeland offers retail fonts as well as custom services.
