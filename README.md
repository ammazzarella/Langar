# Langar

Langar is a one-weight Latin-Gurmukhi display font based on informal, playful letterforms. 
It broadly follows the ‘upright-italic’ style of Latin fonts, experimenting with and introducing a similar style for the Gurmukhi script. 
Langar's harmonised Latin-Gurmukhi design aims to expand the possibilities for both the general user and the specialised designer working with bilingual texts by providing a good quality display option. 
The design specifically caters to characterful display at larger sizes, providing a contrasting secondary style to most text typefaces generally available for Latin-Gurmukhi texts.
