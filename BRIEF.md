Langar is a one-weight Latin-Gurmukhi display font based on informal, playful lettering. It broadly follows the ‘upright-italic’ style of fonts, experimenting with and introducing the same style for the Gurmukhi script. Informal display fonts that provide a friendly, flowing style in Gurmukhi are not common and not easily available. This project will expand the possibilities for both the general user and the specialised designer working with Latin-Gurmukhi texts, by providing a good quality display option. The design will be specifically aimed for web use at larger sizes and provide a contrasting secondary style to most text typefaces generally available.
